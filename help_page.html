        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="turquoise">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
          management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
          part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a urgently effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="turquoise">Join</span> leverages
          the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
          in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that
          <span class="turquoise">Join</span> is designed as an educational
          exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
          strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
          guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
          aspects of quality regarding <span class="turquoise">Join</span>.

              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="turquoise">Join</span>, you'll
                find a default board. This board represents your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                feedback” and "Done".

              <p>
                In <span class="turquoise">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                interact with the tasks on the board.

              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.

              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
