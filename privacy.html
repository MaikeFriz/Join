          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Last updated: October 2023</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our web services,
            you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to
            help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and
            what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to
            read it carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect information to provide better services to all our users.
            We collect information in the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Information you give us. For example, our services require you to
              sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal
              information, like your name, email address, telephone number, or
              credit card.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information we get from your use of our services. We collect
              information about the services that you use and how you use them,
              like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services
              or you view and interact with our ads and content.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We use the information we collect from all our services to provide,
            maintain, protect, and improve them, to develop new ones, and to
            protect our users. We also use this information to offer you
            tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and
            ads.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Share</h2>
          <p>
            We do not share personal information with companies, organizations,
            and individuals outside of our company unless one of the following
            circumstances applies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With your consent. We will share personal information with
              companies, organizations, or individuals outside of our company
              when we have your consent to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              For legal reasons. We will share personal information with
              companies, organizations, or individuals outside of our company if
              we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or
              disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or
                enforceable governmental request.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
                potential violations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or
                technical issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our
                company, our users, or the public as required or permitted by
                law.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce
            your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.
            We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the
            changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice
            (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy
            policy changes).
